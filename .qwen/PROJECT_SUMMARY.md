# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a CMS integration solution for Plasmic that allows embedding the web builder, authenticating users via JWT tokens based on user ID, listing projects in an HTML app, and opening specific projects in the builder when clicked.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Plasmic uses a multi-service architecture with frontend (port 3003), backend (port 3004), and host server (port 3005)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with a database named 'wab' and user 'wab'
- **Node.js Version**: v21.5.0 is required (v25.1.0 causes compatibility issues with buffer libraries)
- **Credentials**: Default admin credentials are email: admin@admin.example.com, password: !53kr3tz!
- **Build Tools**: Uses Yarn for dependency management, rsbuild for frontend bundling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with API key protection for CMS integration
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo with multiple packages including canvas-packages, host, live-frame, react-web-bundle, sub, wab (main application)
- **URL Format**: `http://localhost:3003/p/{projectId}?token={jwtToken}` is the correct format to open a specific project
- **Seeding**: The database seed script `yarn seed` populates the database with test users, projects, and feature tiers
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/v1/cms-integration/generate-token` for JWT token generation, `/api/v1/user/projects` for user project listing
- **Commands**: Use `cd platform/wab && yarn dev` to start the development server that runs all three services

## Recent Actions
- Resolved Node.js version compatibility issues by switching to v21.5.0
- Successfully started backend service on port 3004 with working CSRF endpoint
- Started frontend service on port 3003 and host server on port 3005
- Created admin user with credentials from ADMIN-CREDENTIALS.md
- Ran database seed script to populate database with test data
- Implemented CMS integration API endpoints for generating JWT tokens and user projects
- Created HTML demo file `cms-integration-demo.html` with project listing and builder embedding
- Implemented CSRF bypass for CMS integration endpoints
- Updated redirection to projects view after JWT authentication
- Fixed project opening functionality to properly load specific projects in the builder
- Removed problematic UI elements that interfered with builder loading
- Ensured proper fallback functionality for demo projects
- All services are currently running and accessible via browser
